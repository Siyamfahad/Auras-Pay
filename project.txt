üî∑ Project: AURAS Pay

Decentralized crypto payment gateway for merchants, built on Solana blockchain.
Non-custodial by design ‚Äì payments are always peer-to-peer from customer to merchant.

üöÄ AURAS Pay - Simple Implementation Roadmap

=== PHASE 1: MVP (2-3 weeks) ===

Week 1: Backend Foundation
‚ñ° Setup Node.js/Express server
‚ñ° PostgreSQL database with 3 tables:
  - users (id, email, wallet_address, api_key, credits, created_at)
  - payments (id, user_id, amount, status, solana_pay_url, created_at)
  - transactions (id, user_id, credits_purchased, stripe_payment_id, created_at)
‚ñ° Basic JWT authentication
‚ñ° Generate API keys for users

Week 2: Core Payment Features
‚ñ° Integrate @solana/pay library
‚ñ° Create payment link generator:
  - Format: solana:WALLET?amount=X&label=MERCHANT&message=INVOICE_ID
‚ñ° QR code generation using 'qrcode' npm package
‚ñ° Credit deduction system (1 credit per payment link)
‚ñ° Basic API endpoints:
  - POST /api/payment-link (create payment)
  - GET /api/payments (list payments)
  - GET /api/balance (check credits)

Week 3: Frontend & Payments
‚ñ° Simple React dashboard with:
  - Login/Register
  - Create payment link form
  - Payment history table
  - Credit balance display
‚ñ° Stripe integration for credit purchases:
  - Use Stripe Checkout (hosted solution - no custom forms)
  - Webhook to add credits after payment
‚ñ° Deploy to Vercel/Netlify + Railway/Render

=== PHASE 2: Polish (1-2 weeks) ===

Week 4: User Experience
‚ñ° Better UI with Tailwind CSS
‚ñ° Email notifications (using Resend API or similar)
‚ñ° Payment link sharing (copy to clipboard)
‚ñ° Basic error handling and validation

Week 5 (Optional): Admin Features
‚ñ° Simple admin panel:
  - View all users
  - Manually adjust credits
  - Basic analytics (total payments, revenue)

=== TECHNICAL STACK (Keep It Simple) ===

Backend:
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL (Supabase for hosted option)
- @solana/pay for payment URLs
- Stripe for credit purchases
- JWT for authentication

Frontend:
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios for API calls

APIs to Leverage:
- Stripe Checkout (no custom payment forms)
- Solana Pay (handles payment protocol)
- Resend/SendGrid (email notifications)
- Supabase (hosted database + auth)

Deployment:
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify
- Backend: Railway/Render
- Database: Supabase

=== AVOID COMPLEXITY ===

‚ùå Don't Build:
- Custom payment processing
- Complex transaction monitoring
- Advanced analytics
- Mobile apps (use responsive web)
- Complex user roles/permissions
- Custom authentication (use simple JWT)

‚úÖ Use Instead:
- Stripe hosted checkout
- Solana Pay standard URLs
- Simple credit deduction
- Basic email notifications
- Minimal admin features

=== API ENDPOINTS (Minimal Set) ===

Authentication:
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login

Payments:
POST /api/payment-link (requires API key, deducts 1 credit)
GET /api/payments (list user's payments)
GET /api/balance (current credits)

Credits:
POST /api/purchase-credits (Stripe checkout session)
POST /webhooks/stripe (add credits after payment)

Admin (Phase 2):
GET /admin/users (list all users)
POST /admin/adjust-credits (manually adjust user credits)

=== LAUNCH STRATEGY ===

1. Deploy MVP with basic features
2. Test with 5-10 early users
3. Collect feedback and fix critical issues
4. Add polish features based on user needs
5. Launch publicly with simple pricing

=== PRICING (Simple) ===

Credit Packages:
- 100 credits: $10 ($0.10 per payment link)
- 500 credits: $40 ($0.08 per payment link)
- 1000 credits: $70 ($0.07 per payment link)

This approach gets you to market fast with a working product that users can actually use and pay for.

Phase 1: System Overview

 Goal:

To build a web-based crypto payment platform that allows merchants to:

Create payment links or QR codes via Solana Pay.

Track transactions and manage their account from a merchant dashboard.

Use API to integrate AURAS Pay with their online store.

Access the platform through a prepaid transaction usage model.



---

Phase 2: System Components

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Merchant Dashboard

Registration & login

Create new payment links

View transaction history

View remaining usage credits

Upgrade/top-up credits

API Key management page



---

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Payment Link Generator

Uses Solana Pay Protocol:
Format:

solana:<WALLET_ADDRESS>?amount=AMOUNT&label=MERCHANT_NAME&message=INVOICE_ID

Generates QR code and shareable URL.

Deducts 1 credit from merchant usage balance upon creation.



---

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Transaction Monitoring

Optional: check on-chain whether payment was received (based on merchant wallet, amount, memo).

Integrate Solana RPC or use a service like QuickNode / Triton for indexing.



---

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Usage-Based Access

Merchants operate on a transaction credit model (prepaid).

System tracks number of credits per merchant.

If credits = 0 ‚Üí disable ability to create new payment links or access the API.



---

5.‚Å† ‚Å†Credit Top-Up Flow

Use Stripe / Checkout.com / PayPal to allow merchants to purchase more credits.

After payment confirmation ‚Üí increment transaction_credits in merchant record.



---

6.‚Å† ‚Å†API Integration (for stores)

Merchants can use a secure API key to:

Create payment requests programmatically

Track transaction status


Each successful API usage = deduct 1 credit


Example endpoint:

POST /api/payment-link
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>

Phase 3: Tech Stack

Component	Technology

Blockchain	Solana
Frontend	React / Next.js + TailwindCSS
Backend	Node.js (Express or NestJS) or Python (FastAPI)
DB	PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Web3	@solana/web3.js, @solana/pay
Payment gateway	Stripe or Checkout.com
QR Code	qrcode.react or similar



---

Phase 4: Database Structure (simplified)

Users Table

id | name | email | wallet_address | api_key | transaction_credits | status

Payments Table

id | user_id | credits_added | amount_paid | payment_gateway | created_at

Payment Links Table

id | user_id | amount | label | memo | solana_pay_url | status | created_at


---

Notes:

The system is non-custodial: no wallet keys or assets are held by the platform.

Merchants provide their own wallet address (Phantom, Solflare...).

All payments go directly from the customer to the merchant wallet via Solana blockchain.

Admin should be able to manually adjust credit balances if needed.
